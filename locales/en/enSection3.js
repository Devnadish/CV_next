  S3L2: "User interface design is an essential element of the user experience on websites. When a person visits  site, his first impression is the general view of the page. Therefore, it is necessary that the user interface is attractive and easy to use. The general view of the site indicates the general layout and distribution of sections, buttons and links within the pages of the site. These things should not be vague or confusing for the visitor. Instead, they should be easy to navigate and feature visual indicators that help locate each item. In addition, the responsiveness of the design should also be taken into account, since the screen size of the user's device should not affect his ability to easily use the site.",
