# Next.js

Next.js is a popular open-source framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) React applications. It provides a number of powerful features that make it easier to create fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications. Here are some of the key features of Next.js:

## Server-Side Rendering

Next.js provides built-in support for server-side rendering, which means that web pages are generated on the server and sent to the client as HTML. This can improve performance and SEO, as search engines can more easily crawl and index the content of web pages.

## Automatic Code Splitting

Next.js automatically splits code into smaller chunks, which can improve performance by reducing the amount of code that needs to be loaded by the client. This can also make it easier to develop and maintain large web applications.

## Static Site Generation

Next.js supports static site generation, which means that web pages can be pre-built and served as static files. This can improve performance and reduce server load, as web pages can be served directly from a content delivery network (CDN).

## API Routes

Next.js provides built-in support for creating API routes, which can be used to create serverless functions that run on demand. This can be useful for creating dynamic web applications that require real-time data.

## CSS-in-JS

Next.js includes support for CSS-in-JS, which means that CSS styles can be written directly in JavaScript code. This can make it easier to manage styles and avoid naming conflicts.

Overall, Next.js is a powerful framework for building fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications. With its support for server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, static site generation, API routes, and CSS-in-JS, Next.js provides developers with everything they need to create modern, engaging web applications.
